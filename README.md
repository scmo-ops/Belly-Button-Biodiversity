# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

The objective of this app is to create a interactive dashboard to explore the 'Belly button biodiversity dataset'.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

For this, there will be; a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and a chart that displays the metadata.
